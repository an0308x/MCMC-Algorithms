# MCMC-Algorithms
A collection of MCMC Algorithms



Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a statistical method used to sample from a probability distribution when direct sampling is difficult. It's particularly useful in Bayesian inference, where we want to estimate posterior distributions of parameters given observed data.

1. Markov Chain: A sequence of random variables where each variable's probability only depends on the previous variable's state.
2. Monte Carlo: A class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
